	<h1>FlexFormatter AutoFormat</h1>
	The FlexFormatter allows you to cause a Format or Indent operation to occur when an editor is saved.  Operation for ActionScript and 
	MXML files can be controlled separately.  Check the appropriate box and decide whether you want Format or Indent to occur.
	Operations of either kind can be performed manually as needed.
	<h1>Excluding files from AutoFormat</h1>
	You can exclude files from auto (or batch) formatting by adding a regular expression to match 
	the workspace-relative path in the table on the preference page. For example, to exclude items in package 
	<b>com.mycompany.adobePatches</b>, you could add <b>.*/com/mycompany/adobePatches/.*</b> to the table. Note that you are 
	filtering based on a path (not a package), and that I canonicalize the paths to use forward slashes for 
	convenience, regardless of Operation System. <br>
	The rules are:
	<ul>
	<li>Use a forward slash '/' as the path separator, regardless of operating system</li>
	<li>Use Java regular expression syntax to specify the mask.  See http://java.sun.com/javase/6/docs/api/java/util/regex/Pattern.html</li>
	</ul>
	<h2>Examples</h2>
	<h3>all paths containing a package segment of "adobe"</h3>
	.*/adobe/.*
	<h3>Actionscript files that come from a third party with "org" package (notice the escaped period before the file extension)</h3>
	.*/src/org/.*\.as
	
	<h1>Formatting other file extensions as xml</h1>
	You can also use the formatter as a helper for formatting xml-style files. In the extensions table, add other extension (ex. 'xml') that should be formatted/indented using the mxml pretty printer. <b>CData</b> sections are not formatted.
