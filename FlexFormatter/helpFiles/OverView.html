	<h1>Flex Formatter Overview</h1>
	FlexFormatter is a tool for indenting or formatting your MXML or ActionScript code.
	<ul>  
	<li>Indenting means adjusting the leading whitespace on a line.</li>  
	<li>Formatting means adjusting all whitespace, including newlines.  
	The FlexFormatter also adds the possibility of going beyond formatting by allowing you to modify the order of MXML attributes 
	as part of formatting.</li>
	</ul>
	The FlexFormatter primarily operates on <b>.mxml</b> and <b>.as</b> files.  It is also enabled for <b>.xml</b> files should that prove useful, though
	they will be treated in the same way as .mxml files.<br>  
	By default, Ctrl+I is mapped to Indent, and Ctrl+Shift+F is mapped to Format, but only in the "Editing Flex Source" context
	of FlexBuilder. If you do not have FlexBuilder, you can go to the <b>Window->Preferences->General-Keys</b> preference page
	and search for "MXML" to find the commands <b>Indent MXML/ActionScript</b> and <b>Format MXML/ActionScript</b> and map them in 
	another context.  However, the toolbar icons should still operate regardless.
