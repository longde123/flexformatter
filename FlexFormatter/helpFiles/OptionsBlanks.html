	<h1>Actionscript blank line and spacing settings</h1>
	<h2>Spacing</h2>
		<h3>Spaces inside (,[</h3>
		This is the number of spaces inside parentheses, brackets, and braces (for arrays).  This option is only used if 
		the box is checked.  Otherwise, the individual settings for parenthese, brackets, and braces are used.
		  
		<h3>No spaces between adjacent (,[</h3>
		If checked, nesting characters that appear next to each other will not have spaces between them, regardless of the <b>Spaces inside</b> setting. Ex. <b>[(( x + 2 ) + 3 )]</b>.
		<h3>Spaces before comma, Spaces after comma</h3>
		This is the number of spaces before/after commas as they appear in parameter lists, method arguments, array declarations, etc.
		<h3>Spaces around assignments, Spaces around operators</h3>
		This is the number of spaces on either side of an '=' or boolean/arithmetic operator.  This applies to symbolic operators only.  Text operators (like 'as' and 'instanceof') will always have only 1 space on either side.
		<h3>Spaces around colons</h3>
		This is the number of spaces on either side of a ':' character in variable declarations.
		<h3>Spaces after labels</h3>
		This is the number of spaces after the colon of a labels.  Labels never have any space before the colon.
		<h3>Spaces before open paren (after keyword)</h3>
		This is the number of spaces to use after the end of a control keyword before the open paren.  Ex. between 'while' and '('
		<h3>Spaces before open paren (in function)</h3>
		This is the number of spaces to use before the open paren that starts a function declaration parameter list.
		 	
	<h2>Blank lines</h2>
	<h3>Don't delete existing blank lines</h3>
		If checked, don't delete any lines in the document that only contain whitespace.  This does not mean that line breaks
		won't be removed, only that empty lines (2 or more line breaks in a row) will be preserved.  Additional blank lines
		may be added.  If not checked, then blank lines will be removed depending on the blank lines settings.  Often you
		would leave this item checked so that extra blank lines used to group variable declarations or other code won't be lost.
	<h4>
		If unchecked, then an additional setting is available to preserve some blank lines. The idea is that 'extra' blank lines will be removed, but you won't lose your existing code groupings.
	</h4>  
	<h3>Lines before functions, Lines before classes, Lines before control statements</h3>
		This is the number of blank lines to insert before these items. The idea is to keep a consistent amount of whitespace. Note that if you have "Don't delete blank lines" turned on, then the number of blank lines will never shrink, regardless of this setting.
	<h3>Always generate indent</h3>
		For all lines, even lines with no text, generate indent whitespace (tabs or spaces).  

	<h2>Don't indent // comments in first column</h2>
		If checked, don't indent line comments that start in column one. Some people keep TODO comments there.
