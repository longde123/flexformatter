	<h1>Flex Formatter General Options</h1>
	These options are common to both MXML and ActionScript formatting.  Right now, the only such option is whether to use <bold>tabs</bold>
	or <bold>spaces</bold>.  You should set this option to match what is in the standard FlexBuilder options at
	<bold>Window->Preferences->Flex->Editors->Indent Using</bold>
