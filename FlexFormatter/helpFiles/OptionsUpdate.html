	<h2>FlexFormatter Updates</h2>
		There are a few ways to keep the FlexFormatter plug-in code up to date.  
		<ul>
			<li>Check for new updates manually - 
				Visit the SourceForge site (<b>http://sourceforge.net/projects/flexformatter/</b>) and check to see if there is a new version.</li>
			<li>Click the "Check for Updates" button below - This will check to see if there is a new official release.  Experimental releases will not be returned.</li>
			<li>Check the "Check for Updates at startup" box - This is just like clicking the button manually, except that it's automatic</li>
			<li>In Eclipse 3.4, set up to install from the update site (<b>http://flexformatter.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/FlexFormatter/FlexPrettyPrintCommandUpdateSite</b>) and go to 
				<b>Window->Preferences:Install/Update:Automatic Updates</b> to configure when to check for updates.  Only official (not experimental) releases are released on the update site.</li>
		</ul>
			
	<h2>Settings updates</h2>
		Groups that want to share formatter settings previously only had the option of having each developer manually import the formatter settings via the preference
		page.  However, changes in the standard preferences required each developer to perform the manual step again.  Eclipse does not have a standard
		way of updating workspace-level preferences.  Tearaway_tea suggested the strategy of using a workspace file (under source control) to store the settings, and
		that is what I've implemented.
		<h3>Auto sync from file</h3>
			Check the box to turn on the auto sync option.  In the text field, enter a workspace-relative path to a FlexFormatter properties file.  If you have a project
			"Settings" with a file "ff.properties" in it, the path would be <b>/Settings/ff.properties</b>.  The file could be in a project that all developers have 
			open (i.e. your 'main' project), or could be in a separate project created just for this purpose.  The project would be pushed to source control.  Whenever
			the settings file needs to be modified, the project lead could update the ff.properties file in source control (by whatever method is convenient).  The next time 
			developers synchronize from source control, they will pull down the updated ff.properties file and the FlexFormatter settings will automatically
			be updated.  The file does not need to exist when the setting is established, although the absence of a file will generate a message in the Eclipse error log.  
		<h3>Browse button</h3>
			The browse button is intended as a way to easily find the path to the common FlexFormatter properties file.  It is a standard Eclipse
			dialog, but it's a little strange.  You can type in '*' or '?' or a letter in the top text field and all of the matching files
			in the workspace will be shown.  Select the file and then select which project it is in if the same relative file path exists
			in multiple projects.
		<h3>Save to sync file</h3>
			Mark this checkbox if you are the member of your team who is responsible for actually changing the formatter properties.  If this box
			is checked, then changes in the Eclipse Preferences will be written to the auto sync file.  Then they
			will show up as outgoing differences in the team sync perspective.
